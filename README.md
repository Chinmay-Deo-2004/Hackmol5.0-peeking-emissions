# Hackmol5.0-peeking-emissions
A custom web browser extension to measure the carbon footprint of users as they surf the net. In addition to the extension, we made a website to rank different web pages based on their eco-friendliness as well.

# CO2_Footprint_Tracker_Extension_and_Eco-Ranking_Website
# Overview
Our custom web browser extension and accompanying website aim to raise awareness about the carbon footprint associated with internet usage. The extension measures the carbon dioxide emissions generated by the websites users visit, while the website ranks different web pages based on their eco-friendliness using the CO2 footprint data provided by users of the extension.

# How_Extension_Works

# Tracking_Internet_Usage
Data Collection: The extension tracks internet usage by monitoring the amount of data consumed by the user while browsing websites.
# Calculating_CO2_Emissions
Conversion to CO2 Emissions: The extension utilizes a JavaScript library named co2.js to convert the amount of data consumed (in megabytes) into the corresponding amount of CO2 emissions generated.
# Storing_Data
Database Integration: Once the CO2 emissions data is calculated, the extension sends this information, along with the domain of the website being visited and the status of the website (e.g., whether it's eco-friendly or not), to our database for storage and analysis.

# How_Website_Works

# Data_Presentation
Data Retrieval: The website fetches the CO2 emission data from the database.
# Eco-Ranking
Sorting: The retrieved data is sorted based on the amount of CO2 emissions associated with each website.
# Visualization
Tabular Display: The sorted data is displayed on the website in a tabular format, providing users with insights into the eco-friendliness of various web pages based on their carbon footprint.


# Setting Up the CO2 Footprint Tracker Extension and Eco-Ranking Website
This guide will walk you through the process of setting up both the CO2 Footprint Tracker Extension and the Eco-Ranking Website. Follow the steps below to get started:

# Setting_Up_the_Extension
Download the Extension Source Code: Obtain the source code of the CO2 Footprint Tracker Extension from our repository.
Extract the Files: Extract the downloaded files to a directory on your local machine.
Modify Database Configuration: Open the extension's source code and locate the database configuration file. Update the configuration settings to match your database setup, including the database host, username, password, and database name.
Install Required Dependencies: If the extension relies on any external libraries or dependencies, make sure to install them as specified in the project's documentation.
